# üõí Multi-Vendor Backend Project

## üìñ Project Overview
This project is a **Multi-Vendor Management System** backend. It allows vendors to register, create their own firms (business profiles), and add products under those firms. The admin or dashboard side gives an overview of the total vendors, firms, and products.

This system can be used for building large-scale e-commerce or marketplace applications where multiple sellers can list products.
